Project Summary: 
There are three libraries:
1. A library for converting a database record that is a list of objects into a string.
2. A library for storing strings in binary data files.
3. A library for reading from binary data files.

Using these 3 libraries,

Task-1: A code for storing a series of records about a single relation in a data file. That file should prompt the user, within a while loop, to decide if he/she wants to add more records or quit. If the user chooses the add a record option, We allow him/her to type a comma-separated record and press enter. We convert that record to a string, and then append the record to a single data file using the first two libraries. If the user chooses the quit option, then we stop the program.

Task-2: We just read all the records we stored by running our first file and display the records on the screen. There should be one record per line. For this operation, you will use the last library to read record strings from the data file and the first library to convert the string to a list-format record.
